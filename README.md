# Youth Employment Prediction in South Africa

##  Project Overview

This project uses baseline data from four rounds of a youth labor market survey conducted in South Africa to predict the employment status of individuals one year later. The primary objective is to model this prediction using a clean, modular, and object-oriented Python codebase.

- Engineer meaningful features from raw survey data.
- Use **object-oriented programming (OOP)** to structure the entire modeling process.
- Train and evaluate machine learning classifiers to predict employment status.
- Provide **feature importance analysis** and derive insights for youth employment policy.
